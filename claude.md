# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow
- **DO NOT** automatically stage changes with `git add`
- **DO NOT** automatically commit changes with `git commit`
- Only commit changes when explicitly requested by the user
- Always ask for confirmation before making commits

## Development Approach
- Make code changes as needed
- Wait for user feedback before committing
- User will explicitly say "commit this" or similar if they want changes committed
- Keep changes in working directory until user confirms they're working correctly
